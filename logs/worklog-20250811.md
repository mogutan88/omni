## Session 1 - PRD and Todo Update

### User Request:
Request Datetime: 2025-08-11 09:45:00

User updated the prd.md file and requested to check for the worklog and todo, then update todo based on the latest PRD changes.

### Work Completed:
Completed time: 2025-08-11 09:55:00

### Files Created/Modified:

### Key Decisions:

- Noted that existing workspace code needs to be removed/updated

### Issues/Challenges:
- Significant refactoring needed to remove workspace features from existing code
- UI elements referencing workspaces need to be updated or removed

## Session 2 - Phase 1 Implementation - Workspace Removal and Session Enhancement

### User Request:
Request Datetime: 2025-08-11 10:00:00

User requested to keep implementing Phase 1 based on PRD and todo, specifically removing workspace features and enhancing session management.

### Work Completed:
Completed time: 2025-08-11 10:30:00

- Removed all workspace-related code from the extension:
  - Deleted `src/workspace-manager.js` file entirely
  - Updated `popup.html` to remove workspace UI elements (nav tab, stat card, modal)
  - Updated `popup.js` to remove all workspace functionality and references
  - Updated `index.html` (manager page) to remove workspace sections
  - Updated `manager.js` to remove all workspace-related functions and references
  - Updated `search-manager.js` to remove workspace searching
- Enhanced session management:
  - Added support for named sessions (sessions automatically get timestamp-based names)
  - Implemented single window session saving capability
  - Added `includeAllWindows` checkbox to session save modal
  - Updated save session methods in both popup and manager to handle current window only option
- Updated UI elements:
  - Replaced "New Workspace" buttons with "Save Current Window" buttons
  - Updated search placeholders to remove workspace references
  - Removed workspace-related modals and forms

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/workspace-manager.js` - Deleted
- `popup.html` - Removed workspace UI elements
- `popup.js` - Removed workspace functionality, added single window saving
- `index.html` - Removed workspace sections from manager page
- `src/manager.js` - Removed all workspace-related code
- `src/search-manager.js` - Removed workspace searching functionality
- `docs/todo.md` - Updated to track progress

### Key Decisions:
- Completely removed workspace concept rather than trying to repurpose it
- Enhanced session functionality to support both all-window and single-window saving
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing sessions
- Used clear naming for sessions with timestamps

### Issues/Challenges:
- Had to carefully remove all workspace references across multiple files
- Ensured search functionality still works after removing workspace searching
- Updated all event handlers and UI elements consistently

### Next Steps:
- Test all changes to ensure nothing is broken
- Load extension in Chrome and verify all functionality works
- Test session saving/restoration with both all windows and single window modes
- Verify search functionality works correctly without workspace references
