# Worklog - 2025-08-16

## Session 1 - 06:15-06:30

### Worker Agent: Claude

### User Request:
Request Datetime: 2025-08-16 06:15:00

Implement fixes based on PR #10 review comments

### Work Completed:
Completed time: 2025-08-16 06:30:00

- Analyzed all review comments on PR #10 regarding tab ID reuse bug fixes
- Replaced Date.now() based unique ID generation with crypto.randomUUID() for better uniqueness
- Removed uniqueIdCounter from TabManager constructor as it's no longer needed
- Optimized tab query in restoreTab() to avoid querying all tabs unnecessarily
- Simplified tabIdentifier logic in popup.js and manager.js by removing unnecessary suspended check
- Fixed deprecated substr() usage, replaced with substring()
- Fixed unused parameter warning in getTabLastAccessed() by prefixing with underscore
- Maintained time-based cleanup logic (30 days) instead of tab ID checking
- Created test suite to verify unique ID generation, tab query optimization, and cleanup logic

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/tab-manager.js` - Replaced unique ID generation, optimized queries, fixed cleanup logic
- `src/popup.js` - Simplified tabIdentifier logic
- `src/manager.js` - Simplified tabIdentifier logic
- `test-tab-suspension.html` - Created test suite for verification

### Key Decisions:
- Used crypto.randomUUID() for guaranteed unique IDs instead of timestamp-based approach
- Kept time-based cleanup (30 days) as suggested by reviewer instead of tab ID checking
- Optimized chrome.tabs.query() to use specific URL first, then pattern as fallback
- Removed complex suspended check in tabIdentifier logic for simplicity

### Issues/Challenges:
- Cannot push directly to repository due to permissions
- Some TypeScript warnings about unused parameters remain but are not critical
- Migration of existing suspended tabs needs careful handling to avoid breaking existing suspended pages

### Next Steps:
- Push changes to PR branch when permissions are available
- Test the extension thoroughly with the implemented fixes
- Monitor for any issues with unique ID generation in production
- Consider implementing actual tab activity tracking in getTabLastAccessed()

## Session 2 - 09:30-09:45

### Worker Agent: Claude

### User Request:
Request Datetime: 2025-08-16 09:30:00

Fix Chrome extension installation error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: window is not defined" in src/tab-manager.js:513

### Work Completed:
Completed time: 2025-08-16 09:45:00

- Diagnosed Chrome extension loading error caused by window object access in service worker context
- Fixed TabManager and SearchManager window assignment issues
- Added conditional checks for window object availability
- Ensured compatibility between content scripts and service worker contexts
- Created new branch for the fix and prepared for PR submission

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/tab-manager.js` - Added conditional window check before assigning window.TabManager
- `src/search-manager.js` - Added conditional window check before assigning window.SearchManager

### Key Decisions:
- Used `typeof window !== 'undefined'` check to safely handle window object availability
- Maintained global availability in browser contexts while preventing service worker errors
- Created separate branch for this critical bug fix

### Issues/Challenges:
- Chrome extension service workers don't have access to window object
- Classes need to be available globally in some contexts but not others
- Required careful handling to maintain backward compatibility

### Next Steps:
- Push branch to GitHub and create pull request
- Test extension installation in Chrome to verify fix
- Merge fix to main branch once tested
- Update PR #10 with additional improvements if needed
